        This packet contains our Rental Qualification Criteria. Please read
        thoroughly before submitting your Lease Application (s), Lease Application
        Fee (s), and Holding Fee.
        <br>
        <br>
        Here is a quick summary of our process:
        <br>
        <br>
        Lease Application Review and Approval <br>
        1. Complete your lease application and submit it along with your support
        documents and funds. Application can be submitted in person following
        tour, screen shot Text or via email.
        <br>
        <br>
        2. We will notify you of whether your Lease Application has been approved
        within approximately 48 hours of receiving your full Application Packet
        (Lease application + support documents+ fees).
        <br>
        <br>
        Move in Date & Cost Sheet <br>
        1. When your Lease Application is approved, we will contact you to confirm
        Move-in Date and Time. Please note that we can only hold homes 5 days
        from application approval.
        <br>
        <br>
        2. After we confirm your Move-in Date and Time we will send your Move-in
        Cost Sheet for review.
        <br>
        <br>
        Rental Qualification Criteria <br>
        1. Occupancy Guidelines <br>
        Properties have a maximum occupancy of 4 people. Exception is Panda Properties which have a 6 person occupancy
        <br>
        <br>
        2. Age <br>
        Applicants must be 18 years of age or older, unless deemed to be an adult
        under applicable law with respect to the execution of contracts. (Each
        person who 18 or older will need to submit a separate Lease Application
        and Lease Application Fee.)
        <br>
        <br>
        3. Credit <br>
        A credit report will be completed on all applicants to verify credit
        worthiness. Verified credit history will be entered into an application
        scoring model to determine rental eligibility. Late payments, collections,
        and charge-offs will be negatively scored. Open bankruptcies and
        landlord evictions or collection actions or judgments will result in an
        automatic denial. Poor credit may result in an acceptance contingent
        upon a higher security deposit.
        <br>
        <br>
        4. Rental History <br>
        Prior rental history will be verified. Applicants will be automatically
        denied for the following reasons:<br><br>
        * Eviction within the last seven years<br><br>
        * Outstanding debt/judgment to any prior landlord (Proof of any
        satisfied judgment will be required)

        the monthly rent. To verify the income we require the following:<br><br>

        o A paystub with a year to date figure may be used if the date
        of the check is within 15 days of application submitted. If
        your paystub does not have “Year to Date”, we will need
        pay stubs for the past 6 current, consecutive weeks.<br><br>
        2. Employed (starting new job)<br><br>
        o Signed and dated offer letter on official company letterhead

        numbers, etc.)

        that has resulted in a conviction within the time period prior to the Lease
